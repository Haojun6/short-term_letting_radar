- This is my final year project for Trinity College Dublin.
- Developed an application to monitor short-term rentals in Ireland, utilising JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML5 for the front-end, integrated real-time data analysis for efficient rent monitoring.
- Leveraged Python 3, NumPy, Pandas, and Flask for back-end logic, coupled with MongoDB for data storage and MapBoxAPI for interactive maps, visualised violations in rent pressure zones effectively.
- Trained a residual neural network in machine learning using Python for image recognition and duplicate data elimination. 
- Built a back-end and front-end based on MongoDB, facilitating efficient data processing & seamless user interaction.
